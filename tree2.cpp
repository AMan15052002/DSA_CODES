//properties of binary tree..
//1)  The maximum number of nodes at level 'l' of a binary tree is 2^l.. 
//2)  Maximum number ofnodesin abinary tree of height 'h' is 2^h-1..
//3)  height of tree: no of nodes  right from start to bottom

//4) In binary tree suppose  there is N nodes  minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is 
        //Log2 (N+1)-1






//************************************TYPES OF BINARY TREES******************************



//1.FULL BINARY TREE  :
// A BINARY TREE IS FULL BINARY TREE IF EVERY NODE HAS 0 OR 2 CHILDREN..
                                // OR
//A FULL BINARY TREE IS A BINARY TREE IN WHICH ALL NODES EXCEPT LEAF NODES 
                // HAVE TWO CHILDREN..



//2.COMPLETE BINARY TREE  :
// A BINARY TREE IS A COMPLETLY BINARY TREE IF ALL THE LEVELS ARE COMPLETLY FIELD
// EXCEPT POSSIBLY THE LAST LEVEL AND THE LAST LEVEL HAS ALL KEYS AS  LEFT AS POSSIBLE.




//3.PERFECT BINARY TREE   :
// A BINARY TREE IS COMPLETLY BINARY TREE IN WHICH ALL THE INTERNAL NODES HAVE TWO CHILDREN AND ALL LEAF NODES ARE AT SAME LEVEL...


//4. BALANCED BINARY TREE
// A BINARY TREE IS BALANCED IF THE HEIGHT OF THE TREE IS O(Log N) WHERE 
                   // N IS NUMBER OF NODES..

//EXAMPLE IS :  AVL TREE 
//AVL TREE HEIGHT IS O(lOG N)

//RED BLACK TREE : HEIGHT IS O(LOG N)


//5. DEGENERATE BINARY TREE.
// A TREE WHERE EVERY INTERNAL NODE HAS ONE CHILD..
